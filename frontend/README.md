# User-Side Component of Kanjou

This project is a flutter application that will build a note taking app with AI-powered features. There are multiple screens, all of which are crucial to the application. 

*Note:* Please use the build that has been uploaded to GitHub if possible. The SHA signature on Firebase corresponds to this build, so rebuilding the project on your machine will cause authentication to fail. It's not integral to the functionality of the app (yet), but it will cause the Sign In page to do nothing

## Add Notes
Press the + icon to enter the Create Note page and enter your note information. Press the save icon to save the note.

## Settings
In the settings page, you can choose whether to sync your notes to the cloud when you create a new one. There's also a button to import the notes from the cloud.
Currently, the other options aren't implemented.
